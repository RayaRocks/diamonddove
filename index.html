                <h4>Raja</h4>
                <p>Raja was a male diamond dove who had so much personallity! He had dark grey feathers, with tiny diamond flecks across his wings and back.
                 His face looked just like a pigeons, and he was always so moody! You could always tell if he was upset, happy, excited, or terrified! He had 
                 five chicks with his mate Rani, and was the king of his habitat! Unfortunatly, he escaped into the wild a few months ago, and we havent seen
                  him since. Raja was one of our favorite birds, and he will always be loved. </p>

                <h4>Rani</h4>
                <p>Rani, (Meaning Queen) is one of our original two diamond doves. Unlike her mate Raja, her light grey/almost whitish feathers have a striped pattern rather than
                     spotted. She has been with longer than any of our other doves, and she is the sweetest, most loyal companion ever. Rani is handtrained, and 
                     will come to us with trust, but if you make her upset, she won't let you touch her for a few days! Over five months, Rani raised five chicks 
                     with her mate, and still takes care of her youngest son today! Though she is such a sweet bird, she does as she pleases, living up to her name!</p>

                <h4>Rosie</h4>
                <p>Rosie was our fourth Diamond dove, when she arrived with Raja. She has dappled medium grey feathers, a sweet, gentle face, and light orange eye-ring. Rosie is very 
                    shy and skittish, but she has a big personallity underneath all her fluff! When we call her name, she responds to us and knows when we're going to feed her. She has
                     only hatched one chick so far, with the help of her mate Rover, but she's a great mother! Rosie witnessed one of her fellow birds getting killed, and she survived 
                     her own "almost cat-attack." Overall, she is a wonderful little bird, with a huge personallity!!!
